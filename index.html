        <p>To the sweetest girl ever,
            No matter how many words I say, it's not enough to express how lucky I am to have you. <br>
             I love you so much; you make my days so much better just by existing. <br>
             I love your eyes, your voice, your laugh; I love every single thing about you. <br>
             In the darkest days, you'll find me here by your side. <br>
             You're everything I've always wished for and more. <br>
             I really want us to grow old together and do everything together. <br>
              I want to try a lot of things for the first time with you. <br>
              I promise to try my best to make you the happiest, my angel. ❤️
